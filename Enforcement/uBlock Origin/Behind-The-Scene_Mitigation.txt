! Description: Behind-the-scene network requests are network requests which uBlock or uMatrix cannot associate with a specific tab in your browser. These can be abused by extensions in your web browser or made by web pages using navigator.sendBeacon(), hyperlink auditing, etc. 
! Use them at your own risk.
