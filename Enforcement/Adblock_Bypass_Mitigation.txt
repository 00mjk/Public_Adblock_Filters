! Description: Includes a list of rules to prevent ad servers from bypassing or compromising your privacy when using adblocking software.
! Use them at your own risk.
! =======================================================================================================================================
! Not all rules will with every Adguard software program just simply import the filter for Adguard software. This list will improve overtime.
! This avoids prefecting all together, this is the rule you will need the most. From Cybo1927.
||*^$csp=prefetch-src 'none'
! These two rules replicate the same privacy settings for blocking prefetching from uBlock Origin or Nano Defender for Adguard for Desktop and Adguard for Android.
