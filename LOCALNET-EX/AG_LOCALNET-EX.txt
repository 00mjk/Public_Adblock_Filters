! Description: These are an example of vulnerable IP addresses that should be blocked for increasing security against network attacks from outbound traffic. This filter is meant for AdGuard. You may have to customize a similar filter with your own rules.
! Use them at your own risk.
! =======================================================================================================================================
! Recommended IP addresses in Adguard
! Outbound requests to these IP addresses should be blocked
! unless for a specific reason such as mangaging network administration, an external server, etc.
! See Wikipedia - Reserved IP Addresses (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses),
! IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml),

! for gudiance.
! === Source-Only Addresses ====
! 0.* and [::] IP address ranges have no destination requests.
0.*^$network
[::]^$network
! === IP ranges used by Mobile Carriers or for Carrier-Grade NAT ===
! 100.64.* and 192.0.0.* is used by Mobile ISPs (carriers).
100.64.*^$network
192.0.0.*^$network
! === Stateless Address AutoConfiguration or Link-Local Addresses ==== 
! 169.254.* and [fe**:*] IP ranges is intended when your device is not set to static address or DHCP server. 
169.254.*^$network
||[fe**:*]^$empty
! === Private IPv4 Address Range ======
! These ranges are used for IP addresses associated for a private network. 
10.*^$network
172.16.*^$network
172.17.*^$network
172.18.*^$network
172.19.*^$network
172.2*.*^$network
172.30.*^$network
172.31.*^$network
192.168.*^$network
||[fc**:*]^$empty
||[fd**:*]^$empty
! === Deprecated IP Address Ranges =======
! Optional: 192.168.* range is deprecated. Should not be used. Can be problematic for legacy devices. These rules are disabled for caution. 
!192.198.*^$network
![2002:*]^$network
! Optional: Adguard does not filter out localhost connections by default. You can use the following rules to filter out localhost traffic. Exclusions for localhost traffic may be needed.
!127.*^$network, 
![::1]^$network, 
!localhost^$empty   
! Add IPv6 address range associated with your IPv6 Home ISP Wide-Area Network. This can be found from logging into your router or gateway.
! The rule below is example for ISP Starnet, Czech Republic. 
! [2a02:768:7c00:*]^$network
! If you have a Mobile ISP or carrier, add IPv6 address range associated with your IPv6 Mobile ISP WAN. 
! Use an app such as IP Tools for Android to get Mobile ISP IPv6 WAN address 
! Google a IPv6 Lookup service to figure out the range to block. 
! The rule below is an example for Verzion Wireless.
! [2600:1010:*]^$network
