! Description: Intended for devices that support IPv4 and IPv6 traffic for other Adguard software excluding Adguard for Windows. These are an example of reserved IP addresses that should be blocked for to increase security against network attacks from outbound traffic. Localhost IP addresses are excluded.
! Use them at your own risk.
! =========================================================================================
! Blocking reserved IP addresses in Adguard
! Outbound requests to these IP addresses should be blocked
! unless for a specific reason such as mangaging network administration, an external server, etc.
! Guidance: Wikipedia - Reserved IP Addresses (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses),
! IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml),
! and IANA IPv6 Special Purpose Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml)
! ==============================================================================================================================================
! This list does not block traffic for the following protocols: ICMP, ICMPv6, DHCP, DHCPv6, ARP, etc.
! === Source-Only Addresses ====
! 0.* and [::] IP address ranges have no destination requests.
0.*^$network
[::]^$network
! === IP ranges used by Mobile Carriers or for Carrier-Grade NAT ===
! 100.64.* and 192.0.0.* is used by Mobile ISPs (carriers).
100.64.*^$network
100.65.*^$network
100.66.*^$network
100.67.*^$network
100.68.*^$network

! === Stateless Address AutoConfiguration or Link-Local Addresses ==== 
! 169.254.* and [fe**:*] IP ranges is intended when your device is not set to static address or DHCP server. 
169.254.*^$network
||[fe**:*]^$empty
! Common ranges for Stateless Address AutoConfiguration or Link-Local Addresses
! These will block UDP, TCP, and STUN requests for common ranges provided below.
[fe80:*]^$network
[fec0:*]^$network
! For full protection from [fc**:*] and [fd**:*] addresses please check IPv6Raw-List.txt.
! === Private IPv4 & IPv6 Address Range ======
! These ranges are used for IP addresses associated for a private network. 
10.*^$network
172.16.*^$network
172.17.*^$network
172.18.*^$network
172.19.*^$network
172.2*.*^$network

172.31.*^$network
192.168.*^$network
||[fc**:*]^$empty
||[fd**:*]^$empty
! For full protection from [fc**:*] and [fd**:*] addresses please check IPv6Raw-List.txt.
! === Deprecated IP Address Ranges =======
! 192.88.99.* and [2002:*] range are deprecated. Should not be used. These rules are disabled for caution. 
192.88.99.*^$network
[2002:*]^$network
! === Multicast IP Address Ranges ======
! 224.*/4 and [ff**:*] ranges is group communication where data transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously. Not needed by all software.
224.*^$network
225.*^$network
226.*^$network
227.*^$network
228.*^$network
229.*^$network
23*.*^$network
||[ff**:*]^$empty  
! ======== IPv6 Home ISP DHCPv6 Server & Prefix ========
! Recommended: Add IPv6 address range associated with your DHCPv6 server or prefix of your Home ISP.
! This can be found from logging into your home router or gateway. 
! The rule below is example for ISP Starnet, Czech Republic from the designated prefix example given [2a02:768:7c07:713e::/64]
! This will be enough to cover IPv6 addresses associated with your DHCPv6 server of your Home ISP. No other rules from Home ISP are needed. 
! It is recommended to use the $network modifer for full protection for this kind of rule.
! [2a02:768:7c07:713e:*]^$network
! ========= IPv6 Home ISP or Carrier Private Range =========
! Paranoid: If you can add the entire range that is associate Home ISP global private range that is used for internal purposes. 
! Use a IPv6 Lookup Service, to figure out the range to block. Recommended: https://www.ultratools.com/tools/ipv6Info. 
! Example of this would be [2a02:768::/32] for ISP Starnet, Czech Republic. Use the suggested rule above if you encounter a problem. 
! It is recommended to use the $network modifer for full protection for this kind of rule.
! [2a02:768:*]^$network
! ======== IPv6 Mobile ISP or Carrier Private Range ==========
! Recommended: If you have a Mobile ISP or carrier,you can add the IPv6 address range based on IPv6 address that your Mobile ISP or carrier has assigned to you.
! Use an app such as IP Tools for Android to get IPv6 address your Mobile ISP has assigned to you. Example is [2600:1010:4040:5005:f333:7777:2323:1919]
! Google a IPv6 Lookup service to figure out the range to block.  Recommended: https://www.ultratools.com/tools/ipv6Info
! The rule below is an example for Cellco Part, US, a company partnering with Verzion Wireless based on [2600:1009::/32], [2600:1010::/32], [2600:1010::/32], etc.
! This help protects you just in case the IP address range associated with what your Mobile ISP or carrier is compromised by a malicious attack.
! It is recommended to use the $network modifer for full protection for these kind of rules.
