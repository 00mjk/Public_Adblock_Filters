! Blocking private network IP addresses in Adguard
! Outbound requests to these IP addresses should be blocked
! unless for a specific reason such as mangaging network administration, an external server, etc.
! Guidance: Wikipedia - Reserved IP Addresses (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network),
! IANA Abuse (https://www.iana.org/abuse)
! ==========================================================================================
! This list does not block traffic for the following protocols: ICMP, ICMPv6, DHCP, DHCPv6, ARP, etc.
! === Source-Only Addresses ====
! 0.* and [::] only used for source-only addresses.
0.*^$network
[::]^$network
! === Stateless Address AutoConfiguration or Link-Local Addresses ==== 
! 169.254.* and [fe80:*] IP ranges is intended when your device is not set to static address or DHCP server. 
169.254.*^$network
! For full protection from [fc**:*] and [fd**:*] addresses please check IPv6Raw-List.txt.
! === Private IPv4 & IPv6 Address Range ======
! These ranges are used for IP addresses associated for a private network. 
10.*^$network
172.16.*^$network
172.17.*^$network
172.18.*^$network
172.19.*^$network
172.2*.*^$network
172.30.*^$network
172.31.*^$network
192.168.*^$network
! For full protection from [fc**:*] and [fd**:*] addresses please check IPv6Raw-List.txt.
! === Localhost Ranges =======
! Adguard for Windows is the only Adguard software program to filter localhost. You can use the following rules to filter out localhost traffic. Exclusions for localhost traffic may be needed.
! Websites like leoaffairs.com use localhost to bypass your adblocker. So, this is needed to block loopholes in regards to adblocking.
127.0.0.1^$network
[::1]^$network   
! ======== IPv6 Home ISP DHCPv6 Server & Prefix ========
! Recommended: Add IPv6 address range associated with your DHCPv6 server or prefix of your Home ISP.
! This can be found from logging into your home router or gateway. 
! The rule below is example for ISP Starnet, Czech Republic from the designated prefix example given [2a02:768:7c07:713e::/64]
! This will be enough to cover IPv6 addresses associated with your DHCPv6 server of your Home ISP. No other rules from Home ISP are needed. 
! It is recommended to use the $network modifer for full protection for this kind of rule.
! [2a02:768:7c07:713e:*]^$network
