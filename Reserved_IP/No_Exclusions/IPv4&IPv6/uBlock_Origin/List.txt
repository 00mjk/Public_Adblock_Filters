! Description: Intended for devices that support IPv4 and IPv6 traffic with uBlock Origin. These are an example of reserved IP addresses that should be blocked for to increase security against network attacks from outbound traffic. Deprecated and Localhost IP addresses are enabled.
! Use them at your own risk. 
! ========================================================================================
! Blocking reserved IP addresses in uBlock Origin or NanoDefender
! Outbound requests to these IP addresses should be blocked
! unless for a specific reason such as mangaging network administration, an external server, etc.

! === Source-Only Addresses ====
! 0.* and [::] IP address ranges have no destination requests.
||0.*.*.*^$all
||[::]^$all
! === Stateless Address AutoConfiguration or Link-Local Addresses ==== 
! 169.254.* and [fe**:*] IP ranges is intended when your device is not set to static address or DHCP server. 
||169.254.*.*^$all
! === Private IPv4 Address Range ======
! These ranges are used for IP addresses associated for a private network. 
||10.*.*.*^$all
||172.16.*.*^$all
||172.17.*.*^$all
||172.18.*.*^$all
||172.19.*.*^$all
||172.2*.*.*^$all
||172.30.*.*^$all
||172.31.*.*^$all
||192.168.*.*^$all
! === Localhost Ranges =======
! Optional: Adguard does not filter out localhost connections by default. You can use the following rules to filter out localhost traffic. Exclusions for localhost traffic may be needed.
! Websites like leoaffairs.com use localhost to bypass your adblocker. So, this is needed to block loopholes in regards to adblocking.
||127.*.*.*^$all
||[::1]^$all
||localhost^$all
! ======== IPv6 Home ISP DHCPv6 Server & Prefix ========
! Suggested: Add IPv6 address range associated with your DHCPv6 server or prefix of your Home ISP.
! This can be found from logging into your home router or gateway. 
! The rule below is example for ISP Starnet, Czech Republic from the designated prefix example given [2a02:768:7c07:713e::/64]
! This will be enough to cover IPv6 addresses associated with your DHCPv6 server of your Home ISP. No other rules from Home ISP are needed. 
! ||[2a02:768:7c07:713e:*]^$all
