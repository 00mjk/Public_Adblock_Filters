! Description: Intended for devices that support IPv4 and IPv6 traffic with uMatrix. These are an example of reserved IP addresses that should be blocked for to increase security against network attacks from outbound traffic. Deprecated IP addresses are disabled.
! Use them at your own risk.
! =======================================================================================================================================
! Blocking dangerous IP addresses in uMatrix
! Outbound requests to these IP addresses should be blocked
! unless for a specific reason such as mangaging network administration, an external server, etc.
! See Wikipedia - Reserved IP Addresses (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses),
! IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml),
! and IANA IPv6 Special Purpose Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml) 
! for gudiance.
! Due to uMatrix limitations, only specific IPv6 addresses can be blocked.
! Import these on the My Rules tab of Temporary rules section using the Import from file... button of uMatrix in order for them to work properly.

! === Source-Only Addresses ==== 
! 0.* and [::] IP address ranges have no destination requests.

* [::] * block
! === IP ranges used by Mobile Carriers or for Carrier-Grade NAT ===
! 100.64.* and 192.0.0.* is used by Mobile ISPs (carriers).
* 100.64 * block
* 192.0.0 * block
! === Stateless Address AutoConfiguration or Link-Local Addresses ====
