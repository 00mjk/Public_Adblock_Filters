! Description: Intended for devices that support IPv4 and IPv6 traffic with uMatrix. These are an example of reserved IP addresses that should be blocked for to increase security against network attacks from outbound traffic. Deprecated and Localhost IP addresses are enabled. Exclusions are added to this list.
! Use them at your own risk.
! =======================================================================================================================================
! Blocking reserved IP addresses in uMatrix
! Outbound requests to these IP addresses should be blocked
! unless for a specific reason such as mangaging network administration, an external server, etc.
! Guidance: Wikipedia - Reserved IP Addresses (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses),
! IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml),
! and IANA IPv6 Special Purpose Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml)
! Due to uMatrix limitations, only specific IPv6 addresses can be blocked.
! Import these on the My Rules tab of Temporary rules section using the Import from file... button of uMatrix in order for them to work properly.
