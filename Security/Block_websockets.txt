! Description: Block Websockets for all domains. Websockets are a security risk since they are not subjected to Same-Origin Policy, can be used to scan open ports and Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). 
! Use them at your own risk.
! ====================================================================================================================
! WebSockets are not restrained by the same-origin policy, an attacker can easily initiate a WebSocket request 
!(i.e. the handshake/upgrade process) from a malicious webpage targeting 
! the ws:// or wss:// endpoint URL of the attacked application.
! Websockets can be used to scan for open TCP ports as well from private network. Inspired by LennyFox.
