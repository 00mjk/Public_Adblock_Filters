# Special-Hosts
Adblock filters and blocklists that I have created.

## Types of Lists 

* [`/Attributed/`](https://github.com/InnoScorpio/Special-Hosts/tree/master/Attributed) - Lists containing rules mainly from other sources or users exactly the way they are as intended.

* [`/Enforcement/`](https://github.com/InnoScorpio/Special-Hosts/tree/master/Enforcement) - Lists to help reduce the change of websites and services bypassing your adblocker.

* [`/Experimental/`](https://github.com/InnoScorpio/Special-Hosts/tree/master/Experimental) - Lists with rules that need to undergo testing. These serve as a preview of what is coming in the future.

* [`/HTTP_Insecure/`](https://github.com/InnoScorpio/Special-Hosts/tree/master/HTTP_Insecure) - Lists to help enhance security when visiting HTTP and HTTPS websites.

* [`/Inadvisable/`](https://github.com/InnoScorpio/Special-Hosts/tree/master/Inadvisable) - Lists that can be usable and are not workable due to uncertain issues.
