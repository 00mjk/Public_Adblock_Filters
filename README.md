# Public_Adblock_Filters
Blocklists I created that can be shared and distributed worldwide.

## Type of Lists

* `Combined` - Filters based on rules from various sources. These filters can have many false positives. Whitelisting is heavily needed.

* `Enforcement` - Blocklists or filter intended to mitigate privacy concerns or ways to bypass your adblocker software. 

* `File_Types_Firewall` - Block dangerous filetypes from being download on your system unless you prompt to do so.

* `HTTP_Restricted` - Filters intended to enhance the security of your web browser when visiting HTTP and HTTPS websites. 

* `Personal` - Filters I used for my personal use. The idea or concept of any lists in this folder were alreadly created by someone. This is not meant to be duplicated. 

* `Reserved_IP`  - Block reserved IP addresses from your private network, ISP global address range, DHCPv6 server, and wide area network that should not be freely connected to.
